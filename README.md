## About Helpy

Helpy app is a mobile app that supports the first 3 goals of SDGs, No poverty, zero hunger, and good health.
Suppose one day that you are walking in one of Cairo streets, and you see someone hungry and need food, or on a very cold night, you found someone has a bad need for clothes or blanket or maybe he needs for health care and visit hospital.
Remember with me how many times you have a surplus of food and you have to throw it, and how many times you have to store your good old clothes and buy new on.
